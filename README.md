<!--- PROJECT SUMMARY/OVERVIEW -->
LoL ASSEMBLER is a tool for strategic picks in League of Legends, the most successful MOBA ever. LoL ASSEMBLER helps you to build the perfect team in a smart way, using counter-pick data from the community of players and your own customizable information. The tool is completely free, and can be used in all game modes, with a bunch of related features.

Whether you are a newbie who needs a little impulse to start in the competitive way, an experienced player seeking for challenger tier, a trainer who wants a decision support system, or just a gamer with passion for chess-like planning and strategies, LoL ASSEMBLER will aim you in the fields of justice.

If you are a casual user, click on "download" folder, and then download the .rar file. Uncompress it in a dedicated folder, and double click on the jar. Enjoy!

LoL ASSEMBLER development started in 2015. **The main goal behind it was to test Java, mess around with other concepts (i.e web scrapping) and obtain a tool that get the job done (aiding a player to decide which champions to pick)**. It was not developed with "sharing the code" in mind. Thus, when its development finished in 2016, it was no longer updated. It became rot.

**This code is MESSY, SMELLY and breaks near 90% of what we can call "good practices".** It breaks the DRY principle. It breaks the KISS principle. It is not a good example of clean code. One reason is that its development was focused on the user end (pretty, easy-to-use, informative UI, hiding as many as possible from the user...), but above all, as said, is because the initiall intention was to get something working really quick, and "sell it" as soon as possible.

Why to release it now? **Because its nonsense to hide it**. The project should have been open source from the very beginning. Better late than never.

Maybe someone would find it funny, or even usefull. It can be used as a good exercise to improve the programming skills (fix all the problems you find). And even when League Of Leguends is no longer the beast it was a couple of years before, sure some players may find the tool interesting (the user manual under doc/ folder is big as hell, but it contains everything about how to use the tool. It as even a couple of notes about its technical part. If you feel brave, go read it) It still working, after all.

#### This project has been created trying to make it usefull. This project has been created in order to learn new things. But over all, this project has been created because it is fun. As Isaac Asimov said:

*The most exciting phrase to hear in science, the one that heralds new discoveries, is not 'Eureka' but 'That's funny...'*
