#### This project has been created trying to make it usefull. This project has been created in order to learn new things. But over all, this project has been created because it is fun. As Isaac Asimov said:

*The most exciting phrase to hear in science, the one that heralds new discoveries, is not 'Eureka' but 'That's funny...'*
